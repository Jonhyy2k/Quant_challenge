ACTDR RESEARCH PROJECT - STRATEGY INTENTIONS & OBJECTIVES
================================================================================
Date Created: 2025-10-21
Project: Arbitrage on Correlated Trading with Delayed Response

================================================================================
CORE HYPOTHESIS
================================================================================

Emerging market assets exhibit temporary price dislocations in correlated pairs
due to market inefficiencies. By detecting these lag periods between correlated
assets, we can identify theoretical arbitrage opportunities.

Key Inefficiencies We're Targeting:
  - Low trading volume in emerging markets
  - Low news visibility / information asymmetry
  - Time zone differences between correlated markets
  - Market microstructure differences
  - Different liquidity profiles between asset types

The Mechanism:
  When two assets are strongly correlated, they should move together. However,
  in emerging markets, one asset may respond to market information with a delay
  of milliseconds to seconds after its correlated pair moves. We want to capture
  this offset and quantify the theoretical profit opportunity.

================================================================================
TARGET MARKETS & ASSET CLASSES
================================================================================

PRIMARY FOCUS:
  1. Emerging Market Equities
     - Country ETFs: Brazil (EWZ), Mexico (EWW), China (FXI), Peru (EPU), etc.
     - Individual stocks: Brazilian ADRs (VALE, PBR, ITUB, BBD)
     - Chinese ADRs: (BABA, JD, BIDU, NIO, XPEV)

  2. Commodities (as leading indicators for EM)
     - Metals: COPX (Copper), PICK (Global Metals), GDX/GDXJ (Gold Miners)
     - Energy: USO (Oil), XLE (Energy Sector)
     - Why: EM economies are commodity-dependent; commodity moves should
       predict EM equity moves with measurable lag

  3. Cross-Listed Assets
     - Brazilian ADRs trading on both NYSE and B3
     - Dual-listed creates natural arbitrage opportunities

GEOGRAPHIC FOCUS:
  - Latin America: Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Peru
  - Asia: China, India, Taiwan, South Korea
  - Reason: Different time zones + varying market efficiency levels

================================================================================
METHODOLOGY
================================================================================

PHASE 1: Correlation Discovery [COMPLETED]
  ✓ Analyzed 142 emerging market assets
  ✓ Found 728 pairs with correlation > 0.6
  ✓ Identified 320 pure EM-EM pairs
  ✓ Identified 43 commodity-EM pairs (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

PHASE 2: Lag Detection [NEXT STEP]
  → Use Bloomberg blpapi for intraday/tick data
  → Measure time lag between correlated price movements
  → Focus on:
     - COPX <--> EPU (Copper vs Peru) - Correlation: 0.84
     - PICK <--> VALE (Metals vs Mining) - Correlation: 0.77
     - PICK <--> DEM (Metals vs EM Broad) - Correlation: 0.80
     - Brazilian stock pairs (VALE/SID, ITUB/BBD)
     - Chinese tech pairs (BABA/JD, KWEB basket)

  → Quantify:
     - How many milliseconds/seconds of lag?
     - How consistent is the lag?
     - What's the theoretical profit per lag event?

PHASE 3: Strategy Simulation
  → Model the theoretical arbitrage capture
  → Include transaction costs, slippage, bid-ask spreads
  → Calculate theoretical returns (even if negative after costs)
  → Document why it works or doesn't work

PHASE 4: Machine Learning Enhancement [FUTURE]
  → Build neural network to predict lag events
  → Feature engineering: volume, volatility, time-of-day, macro events
  → Real-time lag detection system
  → Note: Only pursue this AFTER proving lag exists in Phase 2

KEY RESEARCH QUESTIONS
================================================================================

1. Do commodity price movements predict EM equity movements with measurable lag?
   → Hypothesis: Copper moves first, Peru ETF (EPU) responds 100ms-5s later

2. Do individual EM stocks lag behind their sector ETFs during rebalancing?
   → Hypothesis: BABA moves, KWEB rebalances with delay

3. Do dual-listed ADRs exhibit arbitrage windows between US and home exchanges?
   → Hypothesis: VALE NYSE vs B3 pricing differential during overlapping hours

4. How do transaction costs compare to theoretical arbitrage profits?
   → Calculate: spread + slippage + latency cost vs profit per trade

5. Can machine learning improve lag prediction accuracy?
   → Only test after establishing that lag exists in raw data

================================================================================
DATA REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

Bloomberg API Access Needed:
  - Intraday tick data (sub-second level if possible)
  - At minimum: 1-second or 1-minute bars
  - Historical period: 6-12 months
  - Assets: Top 10-15 pairs listed above

Alternative if Bloomberg too expensive:
  - Interactive Brokers API (real-time quotes)
  - Polygon.io (second-level data)
  - Alpha Vantage (minute-level, limited)

================================================================================
SUCCESS CRITERIA (Research Perspective)
================================================================================

This is a RESEARCH project, not a production trading strategy.
Success is measured by documented findings, not P&L.

SUCCESS Scenarios:
  ✓ We prove lag exists and quantify it precisely
  ✓ We prove lag doesn't exist (negative result is still valuable research)
  ✓ We document why arbitrage is/isn't feasible after costs
  ✓ We contribute to academic understanding of EM market efficiency

Does NOT Require:
  ✗ Profitable trading strategy
  ✗ Positive returns after costs
  ✗ Deployable production system

The goal is to TEST THE HYPOTHESIS and document findings rigorously.

================================================================================
NEXT IMMEDIATE STEPS
================================================================================

1. Obtain Bloomberg blpapi access or alternative data source
2. Download tick/intraday data for top 10 pairs
3. Build lag detection algorithm:
   - Lead-lag correlation analysis
   - Cross-correlation functions
   - Time series causality tests (Granger causality)
4. Measure and document results
5. Write research report with findings

================================================================================
NOTES & REMINDERS
================================================================================

- The strategy focuses on EMERGING MARKETS specifically for inefficiency
- Correlation threshold used: > 0.6 (not just perfect correlation)
- Total universe analyzed: 142 assets → 129 valid → 728 pairs found
- Most promising: Commodity-EM pairs (natural lead-lag relationship)
- Remember: Even millisecond lags require HFT infrastructure for actual trading
- For research: Document theoretical opportunity, not trading implementation

Files Generated:
  - find_correlated_pairs.py (initial broad analysis)
  - emerging_markets_correlation.py (comprehensive EM focus)
  - correlated_pairs_findings.txt (first 45 pairs, all assets)
  - em_correlation_report.txt (320 EM pairs, detailed)
  - em_pairs_detailed.csv (all 728 pairs with categories)
